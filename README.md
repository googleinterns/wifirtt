# WiFi RTT Location Tools

This project sets out to design and build tools that enable developing products that support precise indoor location and/or ranging. These tools are based on the IEEE 802.11mc protocol for ranging, which is referred to as WiFi Round-Trip-Time (RTT) in the Android developer world. These tools may support both indoor navigation systems, and peer-to-peer ranging as used by the WiFi Context Aware variant, also known as Neighborhood Aware Networking (NAN).

This is an experimental project: expect prototype code and no support.
